# oblivionOSR
Ideas from Knave and GLOG, smashed together with an Oblivion-shaped hammer into an unrecognizable mess.

## Character Creation

1. Roll 3d6 seven times, once for each Attribute. The lowest individual value is your Bonus, add 10 to get Defense. You may swap three scores.
2. Roll a d8 and add your END bonus for your HP.
3. Gain Magicka Dice equal to half your INT Bonus (rounded up).
4. Choose a Birthsign.
5. Choose a Class. Note your Favored Attributes, roll or choose your starting Skills, and add starting gear for the Class. 
	1. Note that you always start with a Torch, a Dagger, clothes, and d8 Gold in addition to your starting gear.
6. Gain 1 Luck Point.
7. Invent or roll character traits, ancestry, etc.

### Attributes
Attributes have two values: Defense and Bonus. Defense is always 10 higher than the Bonus, and vice versa. If an Attribute is changed, it reflects both values. I.e. Defense 12 going to 13 results in a Bonus of 2 changing to 3.

- Strength (STR): How strong you are, used for melee weapons.
- Intelligence (INT): How smart you are, used for spells.
- Willpower (WIL): How strong-minded you are, used for ranged weapons.
- Speed (SPD): How fast you move, used for combat and overland movement speed.
- Agility (AGL): How dextrous you are, used for dodging and traps.
- Endurance (END): How tough you are, used for health and inventory.

### Skills
- You have Skills that improve your chances of doing certain actions. How these apply is up to the player and GM, but suggestions are given below.
- When you level up, you may put ranks into a Skill, which might improve the Skill's effect. i.e. ranks into Security lets you pick harder locks.
	- Each Rank has a title: Novice (0), Apprentice (1), Journeyman (2), Expert (3), Master (4).
	- Ranks imply difficulty: an Expert-level feat in Acrobatics is a very difficult action. If you're below the rank required, the feat may be impossible or very difficult. If you meet it, it might be a normal skill check. Exceed it, and it might be done automatically or with advantage. Novice-level feats can be tried by anyone.
	- Additional benefits of ranks can be decided by the GM during play.
- Each Skill is associated with an Attribute. Saves with the skill are assumed to be using the Attribute.
- *Mastering* a Skill requires a Master Trainer, but when completed unlocks a special effect for the Skill, decided by the GM. You must have four ranks in the Skill to start Master training.

## Gameplay

### Time
Time is divided into the following:
- A *round* is six to ten seconds
	- Usually the length of a clash in combat.
- A *turn* is ten minutes, or 36 rounds.
	- Usually the amount of time to explore a dungeon room, or to light a campfire.
- An *hour* is 60 minutes, or 6 turns.
	- Usually the amount of time it takes to eat a meal, or to perform a lengthy task.
- A *watch* is four hours, or 24 turns.
	- Usually the amount of time it takes to travel a significant distance, or to craft something.
- A day is 24 hours, or 6 watches. 
	- The day is split into Early Morning (4a-8a), Morning (8a-12p), Midday (12p to 4p), Evening (4p to 8p), Late Evening (8p to 12p) and Midnight (12p to 4a).
- A week is 7 days. 
	- A new week begins on Sundas, and proceeds to Morndas, Tirdas, Middas, Turdas, Fredas, and Loredas.
- A month is four weeks. Three months make a season. Four seasons make a year.

### Exploration & Rest
On the road, you can move up to \[SPD Bonus\} points per day. Each point represents a roadside inn, a landmark of some kind, or simply a popular spot for a rest. Cities and towns count as a point and have their own amenities.

You can move \[SPD Bonus\] hexes per day in the wilderness. You will have to ensure you are properly oriented, or you have the chance of becoming lost. Some hexes are difficult terrain and count as two hexes for the purposes of travel.

#### Rest
- You can take a Quick Break after combat to recover your END Bonus worth of HP. This usually takes a Turn, but you cannot recover MD this way.
- You can take a Rest, lasting about an hour. This usually is a lunch or midday meal. You recover d8+END Bonus worth of HP and AGL Bonus worth of Fatigue. 
- An Overnight Rest fully restores your HP and Fatigue Points.
- A Full Rest is a week spent in a city, town, or other settlement. You gain the benefits of an Overnight Rest, all spent Magicka Dice are placed back into your reserves, any temporary Attribute damage is healed, and most diseases are cured.

#### Inventory
You have a number of inventory slots equal to your STR Defense. Most items take up one slot; smaller items can be bundled together. Bulky items take up two slots and are typically two-handed or awkward to carry. 

Anyone carrying a full inventory is **exhausted**. Exhausted characters treat all SPD, STR, and AGL scores as 10 Defense / 0 Bonus.

#### Fatigue
Fatigue represents your physical and/or mental weariness. You gain Fatigue when you suffer exhaustion. Examples can include:

- Being in active combat for more than 3 rounds.
- Taking a critical hit.
- Failing STR, END, or WIL saves.
- Blocking a heavy or two-handed weapon attack.
- Attacking with a heavy or two-handed weapon.
- Going without an Overnight Rest.
- Going a day without food or water.
- Being in extreme temperatures.
- Taking lightning or ice damage.
- Suffering particular monster attacks or spells.
- Witnessing something disturbing or traumatizing.
- Other types of exertion (determined by the GM).

Each instance of Fatigue takes up an inventory space. You can clear Fatigue by resting or by using magic/potions. If Fatigue is added to a full inventory, you are knocked out.

### Combat

### Magic
- If you obtain any spells from your Class, it is contained in a Spellbook.
- Spells from the Spellbook can be cast using Magicka Dice (MD). You have MD equal to your INT Bonus. Your Magicka reserves are your pool of these dice.
	- Spells refer to \[SUM\] or \[DICE\]: this refers to the sum of the MD result and the amount of MD used, respectively.
	- When you cast the spell, any die result of 4-6 results in that particular MD being removed from your Magicka reserves. A result of 1-3 means the MD goes back into your reserves after you cast the spell.
	- You can use a maximum of 4 MD per spell.
	- You gain back half of your WIL Bonus MD (rounded up) when you do a Short or Overnight Rest.
	- Rolling doubles incurs a Mishap. Rolling triples incurs a Doom.
- Further spells can be obtained via scrolls, spell tomes, or wizards willing to teach their craft.
	- Copying a spell into your Spellbook takes expensive magic ink and a Watch to complete. Reduce the time by \[SUM\] hours if you want to use magic to help you.
	- If you use a tome or scroll to copy from, it is destroyed in the process.
- Creating a Spellbook takes several magical inks, a blank book, and a spell scroll. They can also be purchased from specialist magicians, such as the Mage's Guild.
